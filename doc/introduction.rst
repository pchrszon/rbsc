Introduction
============

``rbsc`` is a tool for verification and quantitative analysis of role-based
systems by means of probabilistic model checking. It provides a modeling
language that extends the input language of the probabilistic model checker
`PRISM <http://www.prismmodelchecker.org>`_ with role-related concepts. The
``rbsc`` tool is not a probabilistic model checker. Rather, it translates a
role-based model into the PRISM language. Then, PRISM can be used for carrying
out the quantitative analysis.
