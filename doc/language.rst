Role-based modeling language
============================

The tool provides a role-based modeling language (RBL) for describing
role-based systems. In the following, familiarity with the PRISM language is
assumed.

A role-based model consists of three parts. First, all component types, i.e,
natural types, role types and compartment types are declared. The second part
specifies one or more system instances by a set of constraints. The third part
defines the behavior of the components.
